# Project Goals
A way to visualize rust projects. Lays the groundwork for encapsulating architecture patterns in visual components.

## Features
* Web-based developer tool 
* Drag-and-drop visual components that indicate system components
* Bi-directional code generation and code interpretation 

## Setup
1. Ensure you have cargo-make installed. 
    * `cargo install cargo-make`
2.
    * If you want to run this code in a web browser:
        * `cargo make serve`
        * go to: http://127.0.0.1:4000
    * If you want to run the code natively:
        * `cargo make run`
